Program for drawing objects, text, and images on an oscilloscope using audio output.

This allows for 3D rendering of `.obj` files, `.svg` images, and `.txt` files.

Read more about '[Rendering shapes through audio signals](https://felixonline.co.uk/issue/1773/science/rendering-shapes-through-audio-signals)' in this article featuring osci-render!

Some of this was built as part of a 24hr hackathon: IC Hack 20. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/wdhg/ICHack20 It won 'Best Newcomers Prize' at the event.

### Video Demonstration

[![osci-render demonstration](https://img.youtube.com/vi/feQzC_Tz5K4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feQzC_Tz5K4)

## Current Features

- Render `.obj` files on an oscilloscope
- Render `.svg` files
- Render text
- Rotation of objects
- Scaling images
- Translating images
- Applying image effects
- Save rendered audio to .wav file
- Show current frequency of audio

## Proposed Features

- Mac OS support (Coming soon)
- Tune and transpose audio output
- Support rendering of multiple objects
- (long term) Keyframing/animating objects and camera

## Usage

Using osci-render is very easy; run the program and choose the file you would like to render, and it will output as audio to visualise on your oscilloscope.

By default, the program loads the example cube object. If this is working, you're good to go and should be able to load your own objects, files, or images!

Control the output using the sliders and text boxes provided. Currently the following can be controlled:

- Translation and speed of translation of the output
- Weight of the lines drawn
- Rotation speed
- Scale of the image

There are some additional controls for `.obj` files:

- Focal length of camera
- Position of camera
- Rotation speed
- Rotation direction

Additional effects can be applied to the image such as:

- Vector cancelling
- Bit crush
- Horizontal/Vertical distortion
- Wobble (plays sin wave at same frequency as output)

## Running

Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases) and download the latest `.exe`, `.deb`, or `.jar`.

`.exe` or `.deb` is recommended, if possible, as it is simpler to get up and running.

### Running using .exe

- Download the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Open the `.exe` skipping any Windows security warnings
- It should open briefly and then close without any user input
- Check your start menu for `osci-render` or open `osci-render.exe` at `C:\Program Files\osci-render`
- Start rendering!

Updating to later versions is as simple as running the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` again.

To uninstall, use Windows control panel, as you would expect.

### Running using .deb

- Download the latest `osci-render_VERSION-1_amd64.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Install as usual, according to your distro
  - e.g. on Ubuntu, just double click to open and choose software installer
- After installing, you can execute `/opt/osci-render/bin/osci-render` to run!
- Start rendering!

Updating to later versions is as simple as running the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` again.

To uninstall, use Windows control panel, as you would expect.

### Running using .jar

- Download the latest `osci-render-os-VERSION.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
  - Download the version that is relevant to your OS, otherwise the program will not open
  - i.e. `osci-render-win-VERSION.jar` for Windows and `osci-render-unix-VERSION.jar` for Linux
- Download and install [Java 16 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
- Run the following command from your terminal to run the `.jar`, substituting the correct path to your `.jar` file 
- `java "-Dfile.encoding=UTF8" -jar "PATH/TO/osci-render-os-VERSION.jar"`
- Start rendering!

## Building

I am using Maven for dependency management and to package the program. Doing the following will setup the project. I highly recommend using IntelliJ.

- Download and install [Java 16 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
- Run `git clone git@github.com:jameshball/osci-render.git`
- Open the project in IntelliJ
- You're good to go!

You should now be able to run `sh.ball.gui.Launcher` and start the program ðŸ˜Š
