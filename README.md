Program for drawing objects, text, and images on an oscilloscope using audio output.

This allows for 3D rendering of `.obj` files, `.svg` images, and `.txt` files.

Some of this was built as part of a 24hr hackathon: IC Hack 20. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/wdhg/ICHack20 It won 'Best Newcomers Prize' at the event.

### Video Demonstration

## Current Features

- Render `.obj` files on an oscilloscope
- Render `.svg` files
- Render text
- Rotation of objects
- Scaling images
- Translating images
- Applying image effects
- Save rendered audio to .wav file
- Show current frequency of audio

## Proposed Features

- Tune and transpose audio output
- Support rendering of multiple objects
- (long term) Keyframing/animating objects and camera

## Usage

Using osci-render is very easy; run the program and choose the file you would like to render, and it will output as audio to visualise on your oscilloscope.

By default, the program loads the example cube object. If this is working, you're good to go and should be able to load your own objects, files, or images!

Control the output using the sliders and text boxes provided. Currently the following can be controlled:

- Translation and speed of translation of the output
- Weight of the lines drawn
- Rotation speed
- Scale of the image

There are some additional controls for `.obj` files:

- Focal length of camera
- Position of camera
- Rotation speed
- Rotation direction

Additional effects can be applied to the image such as:

- Vector cancelling
- Bit crush
- Horizontal/Vertical distortion
- Wobble (plays sin wave at same frequency as output)

## Running

Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases) and download the latest `.exe` or `.jar`.

`.exe` is highly recommended if you're on Windows as it is much simpler to get up and running.

### Running using .exe

- Download the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Open the `.exe` skipping any Windows security warnings (at your own risk!)
- It should open briefly and then close without any user input
- Check your start menu for `osci-render` or open `osci-render.exe` at `C:\Program Files\osci-render`
- Start rendering!

Updating to later versions is as simple as running the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` again.

To uninstall, use Windows control panel, as you would expect.

### Running using .jar

- Download the latest `osci-render-VERSION.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Download and install [Java 15 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
- Donwload and unpack [JavaFX 16 or later](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
  - Make sure you scroll down to `Latest Release`
  - Download the SDK for your platform
  - Unpack the `.zip` at your root directory (e.g. `C:\javafx-sdk-16` for me on Windows)
  - The `lib` subfolder should be located at `/javafx-sdk-16/lib`
- Run the following command from your terminal to run the `.jar`, substituting the correct paths 
- `java --enable-preview --module-path /javafx-sdk-16/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar "path/to/osci-render-VERSION.jar"`
- Start rendering!

## Building

I am using Maven for dependency management and to package the program. Doing the following will setup the project. I highly recommend using IntelliJ.

- Download and install [Java 15 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
- Run `git clone git@github.com:jameshball/osci-render.git`
- `cd` into the `osci-render` directory
- Run `mvn package`
- Open the project in IntelliJ
- Add `target/modules` as a library
  - Right click the folder in IntelliJ and `Add as Library...`
  - Select `osci-render` in the `Add to module` dropdown
- Navigate to `File -> Project Structure`
- Remove all external Maven libraries other than the `modules` folder just added
- You're good to go!

You should now be able to run `sh.ball.gui.Gui` and start the program ðŸ˜Š
