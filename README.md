Program for making music by drawing objects, text, and images on an oscilloscope using audio output.

This allows for 3D rendering of `.obj` files, `.svg` images, and `.txt` files on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

You can use MIDI to interface with osci-render to make and record music.

## Usage

Using osci-render is very easy; run the program and choose the file you would like to render, and it will output as audio to visualise on your oscilloscope.

By default, the program loads the example cube object. If this is working, you're good to go and should be able to load your own objects, files, or images!

Control the output using the sliders and text boxes provided. Currently the following can be controlled:

- Translation and speed of translation of the output
- Weight of the lines drawn
- Rotation speed
- Scale of the image

There are some additional controls for `.obj` files:

- Focal length of camera
- Position of camera
- Rotation speed
- Rotation direction

Additional effects can be applied to the image such as:

- Vector cancelling (every other audio sample is inverted)
- Bit crush
- Horizontal/Vertical distortion
- Image Wobble (plays sin wave at same frequency as output)
- Smoothing
- Image Trace (traces out the image, drawing only a portion of the whole image)

### Using osci-render without an oscilloscope

Obviously, not everyone has access to an oscilloscope, let alone an analogue oscilloscope. Luckily there are some decent software alternatives that are a good option once they're setup.

- First, download a virtual audio input/output device
  - This routes audio from osci-render to the software oscilloscope
  - On Windows, I use [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
    - Set the digital input to be your default output device
    - Set the digital output to be your default input device
    - Then you can listen to the digital output to duplicate the audio to your headphones/speakers
  - On macOS, [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) is also available
  - [Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) and [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) (paid, but better) are also options for macOS
- Then, download a software oscilloscope
  - There are quite a few options available
  - My preferred option is https://dood.al/oscilloscope/
    - You need to click [reset all] when you first load the page otherwise there are no visuals
    - Just tick the microphone checkbox and it should listen to your default input device!
  - https://asdfg.me/osci/ is another good option
    - This can be buggy, and doesn't look as realistic
    - Just press the mic icon and choose your digital audio device you have routed osci-render to
- Contact [james@ball.sh](mailto:james@ball.sh) if you need any help

### MIDI

You can use MIDI to control the frequency of the output - just plug in or open a MIDI software/hardware device and open osci-render and start playing notes!

To control the sliders using a MIDI slider or knob from a physical device, do the following:

- First, plug-in MIDI device
- Open osci-render
- Click MIDI logo next to the slider you want to control
- Red means the slider is 'armed' and waiting for you to choose a MIDI key to associate it with
- Move a CC slider/knob etc. on your MIDI device
- The MIDI logo now turns green, and is controlled by your MIDI device!

## Installing

Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases) and download the latest `.exe`, `.pkg`, `.deb`, or `.jar`.

`.exe`, `.pkg`, or `.deb` is recommended, if possible, as it is simpler to get up and running.

### Installing using .exe (Windows)

- Download the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Open the `.exe` skipping any Windows security warnings
- It should open briefly and then close without any user input
- Check your start menu for `osci-render` or open `osci-render.exe` at `C:\Program Files\osci-render`
- Start rendering!

Updating to later versions is as simple as running the latest `osci-render-VERSION.exe` again.

To uninstall, use Windows control panel, as you would expect.

### Installing using .pkg (macOS)

- Download the latest `osci-render-VERSION.pkg` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Since I haven't paid for a developer licence, you'll be warned that it is from an 'unidentified developer' when trying to run the installer
- To mitigate this, do the following (explained on the [macOS User Guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac))
  - Locate the downloaded `.pkg` file in Finder
  - Control-click the file, and choose Open from the shortcut menu
  - Click Open
- Follow the steps in the installer
- Open `osci-render` from the Launchpad
- Start rendering!

### Installing using .deb (Ubuntu)

- Download the latest `osci-render_VERSION-1_amd64.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
- Install as usual, according to your distro
  - e.g. on Ubuntu, just double click to open and choose software installer
- After installing, you can execute `/opt/osci-render/bin/osci-render` to run!
- Start rendering!

### Running using .jar (all platforms)

- Download the latest `osci-render-os-VERSION.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render/releases)
  - Download the version that is relevant to your OS, otherwise the program will not open
  - i.e. `osci-render-win-VERSION.jar` for Windows and `osci-render-unix-VERSION.jar` for Linux
- Download and install [Java 17 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Run the following command from your terminal to run the `.jar`, substituting the correct path to your `.jar` file 
- `java "-Dfile.encoding=UTF8" -jar "PATH/TO/osci-render-os-VERSION.jar"`
- Start rendering!

## Building

I am using Maven for dependency management and to package the program. Doing the following will setup the project. I highly recommend using IntelliJ.

- Download and install [Java 17 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Run `git clone git@github.com:jameshball/osci-render.git`
- Open the project in IntelliJ
- I use [SceneBuilder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) to edit the GUI
  - The FXML project files for each GUI element are located in `src/main/resources/fxml`
- You're good to go!

You should now be able to run `sh.ball.gui.Launcher` and start the program ðŸ˜Š
