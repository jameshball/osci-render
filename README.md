# osci-render

Project for drawing lines on an oscilloscope using audio output.

This allows for 3D rendering of any generic object (.obj file)

I will continue adding extra fuctionality, such as outputting another audio channel to control the intensity of the beam for lines drawn further away, and improving the drawing algorithm and quality. I also want to look into whether it is possible to tune the audio output to a specific note and transpose from there so I can start to make music.

Lots of this code was built as part of a 24hr hackathon: IC Hack 20. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/wdhg/ICHack20
