# Trademarks and branding

"osci-render" and "sosci" are project names used to identify this software.
The osci-render and sosci names, logos, and other branding assets are protected by
trademark/passing-off law and by copyright.

## License scope clarification

The source code in this repository is licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 3 (GPLv3) (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

The GPLv3 license applies to the source code and does not grant permission to use
project trademarks, service marks, logos, or other branding. Any permission to use
such branding must come from a separate, explicit grant.

Nothing in this document is intended to limit the rights granted to you under the
GPLv3 to copy, modify, or redistribute the software; it only addresses trademark
and branding usage.

## Where branding assets live

Branding assets (logos/wordmarks) are kept alongside other assets in:

- [Resources/images](Resources/images)
- [Resources/svg](Resources/svg)
- [images](images)

See the per-directory notices in those folders for which files are considered branding assets.

## Forks and redistributions

You may copy, modify, and redistribute the GPLv3-licensed code.

If you distribute a modified build or fork, do not use the osci-render/sosci names
or logos in a way that suggests your build is the official project or is endorsed
by the project authors, unless you have permission.

Nominative use (e.g. "based on osci-render") is generally fine; using the name/logo
as the primary branding of your fork or in a way that implies endorsement is not.

## Permission

If you would like permission to use the osci-render/sosci branding (e.g. for
packaging, marketing, or redistribution), please contact the project maintainer.
